# Reformulation-Linearization-using-symmetry
This project seeks to build a reformulation linearization (RLT) for non-linear programming problems and then reduce its size using symmetry. The problem instances are taken from https://minlplib.org/instances.html.

The RLT_converter (5).ipynb file takes as input a python pyomo model of non-linear program as input. It then builds a RLT relaxation LP and prints the solution.
